# HousefreeAPI

## Welcome to HousefreeAPI!

This is a platform that provides a one-stop solution for all your housing needs. With HousefreeAPI, you no longer have to worry about searching for apartments, inspection, logistics, and interior decoration. Our platform takes care of all these for you.

This repo contains the source code for our API. Our API is built using Python and Django, and it connects to a PostgreSQL database. The API handles all the necessary functionality for the platform, including user authentication, apartment listing, and payment processing.

To get started with the API, you will need to have Python and Django installed on your machine. You can install these by following the instructions on their respective websites. Once you have these installed, you can clone the repo and run the following commands:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver

This will install all the necessary dependencies, create the database tables, and start the development server. You can then access the API by going to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser.

In addition to the API, we also provide a frontend web application that utilizes the API. The source code for the web application can be found in our other repository.

We are always looking for ways to improve our platform, so feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any suggestions or find any bugs.

Thank you for checking out HousefreeAPI!
